<p>Well, I am also new to Git, Github and other version control systems.  So, correct me if I am wrong somehwere.</p>

<h1>Version Control Systems and Why do we need one?</h1>

<p>So this page explains a little about what version control systems are and why do even need them in our life.  I mean why should we be worry about something whose existence does not even count.  But let me tell you, Version Control System is something which is most important for any content maker (Not only Software developers but also article writers) and it has many benefits.</p>

<p>  You can think VCS (Version Control System) as any tree, say mango (or as you like, it doesn&rsquo;t matter).  If you guys don&rsquo;t understand something, imagine its tree analogy and the examples I depicted (they may help you).  Like every tree, VCS stands on its root, which is the very reason for tree&rsquo;s existence.</p>

<p>   Now, in real world analogy, suppose you are doing something new, something experimental and you don&rsquo;t know what would happen next.  Say, you are cooking a cake.  To cook a cake, you would require few items (wheat flour, butter, milk, sugar, &hellip;) which when properly baked yield a cake.  If you are new to cooking, you might mess everything up with nothing left at last to eat if you don&rsquo;t plan your cooking (as a beginner).  It would be better if you take small and slow steps, saving your progress.  Like mix the batter and put it aside, heat the oven, let it bake, ice it and so on.</p>

<p>   Now, in other context, You are playing a game which allows you to save your progress at every level as checkpoints so that whenever you come back you can start where you left off or whenever you fail to pass Boss Level, you don&rsquo;t have to play all those level again and again. Similar in VCS, when you try out something new, you will always want to save your progress so that you don&rsquo;t have to start over again and even if you fail you can start from you r most recent checkpoint.</p>

<p>  Upto now, we talked about how VCS can save your progress but the best part of the story is yet to come.  Many a times, you may have wondered, what would happen if I didn&rsquo;t do that particular task, would the situation be different now.  Would I be able to do this problem if I had read that article?  Would humans still exist if Dinosaurs didn&rsquo;t extinct?  You guys might have wondered these kind of questions, if not, wonder now because humans only evolve by wondering.  Now, what if you don&rsquo;t have to wonder these questions anymore.  Wouldn&rsquo;t it be better if you could find out the answers yourself!</p>

<p>   Now, here comes the power of VCS, you can save all your progress at any point you want and come back later to any of these saved chaeckpoints to find out the answers of your what would happen questions.  Finding answers to questions can be fascinating.  In more <em>technical way</em>, we create a new <strong>branch</strong> on that tree of our VCS growing out of the root and then find out the answers whether you will reach the top or not if you led that branch.  The best part is that you can create as many branches you want, try everything you can think of and achieve the heighest branch of the tree.  And even if you fall off a branch, you know you have the stem (the master branch) to grow more branches on. (Just the tree analogy)</p>

<p>   For, the cooking case, if you wondered, could my cake be more tasty if I added that secret ingredient?  So, now you can find out by going back into time to your saved point.</p>

<p>   For the gamers case analogy, if you wondered, would my rank/score be better if my health wasn&rsquo;t so low?  Now, you can replay that level to find out.</p>

<h2>Why VCS</h2>

<p>  By now, you all are aware of the VCS system, its power of VCS, its benefits and you might have already find out its use for you.  But where?</p>

<p>VCS system is highly popular among software developers to write and test their software.  It allows them to try anything with their code, experiment with it without the fear of any accidents.</p>

<p>But it does not mean VCS do not have use at any other place.  As I said, VCS is useful for any content maker, whether software, or articles, or books or anything.  Ever see the <strong>edition</strong> tag on the book cover, why do you think they tag edition of the cover?  These are their checkpoints to their progress and not only the editions of the books, every author must have written their book chapter-wise, thus those chapters are also their checkpoints or better analogous to branches. They arrange the branches later on when they publish it.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>   VCS is a utility system and with its help we can experiment, learn something new by taking small, slow and progressive steps.  You can save your progress and find out the answers to wonder why questions by branching out of its <strong>master branch</strong>.  So, by now you might have understood what is a VCS (Version Control System) and why do we even need one.  The simplest answer is that it takes all our fear of ruining our precious work by experimenting and give us the power to make our more precious by experimenting it.</p>

<p>   I even wrote this page using a VCS itself and hosted my webpage by Git-hub.</p>

<p><em>Even If this page does not make sense to you, do not worry, you have taken your first step in VCS, with this as root, you will always be benefited with this content to grow more branches.</em></p>
